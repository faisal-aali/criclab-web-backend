Robust method: RANSAC motion-model fitting. A ball in flight follows
    x(t) ~ x0 + vx*t          (near-constant horizontal pixel velocity)
    y(t) ~ y0 + vy*t + a*t^2   (parabola under gravity, in image pixels)
where t is the frame index. Random noise from grass, clouds, and camera shake
does NOT fit one consistent model across many consecutive frames, so it is
rejected as outliers. This is far more reliable than greedy nearest-neighbour

    Two things make a naive fit under-read badly:

    1. The ball recedes from the camera, so its pixel speed decays along the
       flight — x(t) is not a straight line. Fitting x linearly over half the arc
       and taking the median returns the mid-flight speed, not the release speed.
       Here x and y are both fitted as quadratics and differentiated at the first
       in-air sample.
    2. The window must stay near release. We use the first ~0.12 s of flight,
       where the ball is still close to the bowler's own depth plane.

    The quadratic derivative at an endpoint is noise-sensitive, so it is bounded
    against the raw early per-frame steps and falls back to their median if the
    fit runs away.
